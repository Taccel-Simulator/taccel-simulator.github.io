# Installation

Taccel runs on Python > 3.10. We strongly recommend using a virtual environment with tools like conda.


## Install the Essential Libraries

```shell
sudo apt install libsuitesparse-dev
```

## Clone Our Repo and Install Taccel


```shell
git clone --recursive https://github.com/Taccel-Simulator/Taccel -b main
cd Taccel
```

After cloning, go through the following steps:

### Prepare a Virtual Environment

Create a virtual environment:

```shell
conda create -n taccel python=3.10 -y
```

Install required packages:

```shell
conda activate taccel
pip install -r requirements.txt

# A few more dependencies that requires torch being already installed
pip install torch-scatter
```

### Install Our Fork of NVIDIA Warp

We need to install a modified fork of NVIDIA Warp. It keeps the update from the [NVIDIA/Warp](https://nvidia.github.io) repo, but with the context module modified to force loading kernels from the PTX files.

```shell
cd thirdparty/warp
python build_lib.py
pip install -e .
```

This step is problematic. For issues please refer to [this page](https://nvidia.github.io/warp/installation.html#building-from-source). Some FAQs below:

#### FAQ 1: CUDA Toolkit

Before building, make sure that the CUDA Toolkit 12.x is installed. You may need to set the environment variable if related errors occur:

```shell
# Optional: We need CUDA 12
export CUDA_HOME=/usr/local/cuda-12.x
```

#### FAQ 2: `'GLIBCXX_3.4.30' not found`

A frequent problem is:

```
OSError: <...>/libstdc++.so.6: version `GLIBCXX_3.4.30' not found (required by <...>/warp/warp/bin/warp.so)
```

To solve this, upgrade the `libstdcxx-ng` with conda:

```shell
conda install -c conda-forge libstdcxx-ng=12.1
```

#### FAQ 3: `cc1plus: execvp: No such file or directory`

This may be due to errors in your `g++` installation. Please refer to [this page](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36353302/gcc-cannot-find-cc1plus).

#### FAQ 4: `Packman` timeout fetching `libmathdx`

If the `packman` cannot download the `libmathdx` due to Internet connection issues, [download `libmathdx`](https://developer.nvidia.com/downloads/compute/cublasdx/redist/cublasdx/libmathdx-Linux-x86_64-0.1.2.tar.gz) manually, unzip the package, and pass the directory with the `--libmathdx_path` argument. For examples:

```shell
python build_lib.py --libmathdx_path=/home/jensen/utils/libmathdx
```

### Install the Warp-IPC and Taccel

Then we will come back:

```shell
cd ../..  # get back to the root dir
pip install -e .
```

This will install `warp_ipc` and `taccel` packages.

### Finish

After the steps above, your Taccel repo is ready to go.
